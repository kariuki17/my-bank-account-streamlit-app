What You're Aiming For
In this checkpoint, we are going to work on the 'Financial Inclusion in Africa' dataset that was provided as part of the Financial Inclusion in Africa hosted by the Zindi platform.

Dataset description: The dataset contains demographic information and what financial services are used by approximately 33,600 individuals across East Africa. The ML model role is to predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account.

The term financial inclusion means:  individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs – transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance – delivered in a responsible and sustainable way.
